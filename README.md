# Verilog to UVMEnv testbench path

This project shows the step-to-step for creating a verification environment using different tools, from typical verilog testbench until using UVMEnv.

Each example us used in one or other way into UVMEnv projects, which can be viewed in its main repo.

## Examples
Testbenches are developed using an ALU model with the next tools:
1. Icarus (Typical simulation).
2. Verilator (Co-simulation).
3. "Veripython" (Use of Verilator + Python for making co-simulation).
4. Cocotb (Coroutine Cosimulation testbench).
5. UVM (Universal Verification Metodology).
6. PyUVM (UVM implementation with Python).
7. UVMEnv (Open-source framework for Python UVM testbenches).
